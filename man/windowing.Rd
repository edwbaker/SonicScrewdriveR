\title{Windowing Function for Wave Objects}
\usage{
windowing(
  wave,
  window.length,
  FUN,
  window.overlap = 0,
  bind.wave = TRUE,
  complete.windows = TRUE,
  cluster = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{A Wave object or filename. Using filenames may save loading an
entire large file into memory.}

\item{window.length}{The length of the analysis window (in samples).}

\item{FUN}{FUN to be applied to windows.}

\item{window.overlap}{The overlap between successive windows (in samples), a
negative value will result in a gap between windows.}

\item{bind.wave}{If TRUE and FUN returns wave objects, then these are
combined into a single object}

\item{complete.windows}{If TRUE (default) the final window will not be
processed unless it has a length equal to window.length.}

\item{cluster}{A cluster form the 'parallel' package for multi-core computation.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to FUN}
}
\description{
Separates a Wave object into windows of a defined length and runs a function
on the window section. Windows may overlap, and the function can make use of
'parallel' package for multi-core processing. It will also show a progress bar
if the 'pbapply' package is installed.
