## Introduction

The `sonicscrewdriver` package can be used to generate a variety of acoustic test signals.

## Sine sweeps

A sine sweep is a signal that increases in frequency over time. The `sweptsine()` function can be used to generate a sine sweep signal. The following example generates a sine sweep signal that starts at 20 Hz and ends at 20 kHz.

````{r}
sweep <- sweptsine(20, 20000)
seewave::spectro(sweep)
````

By default linear sweeps are generated, but it is also possible to generate logarithmic sweeps by setting the `mode` argument to `"log"`.

````{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
sweep <- sweptsine(1, 100)
seewave::oscillo(sweep, title="Linear")
sweep <- sweptsine(1, 100, mode="log")
seewave::oscillo(sweep, title="Logarithmic")
````
