    abstract = "{This paper describes a precise numerical calculation of the specific heat ratio and speed of sound in air as a function of temperature, pressure, humidity, and CO2 concentration. The above parameters are calculated utilizing classical thermodynamic relationships and a real gas equation of state over the temperature range 0 °C–30 °C. The shortcomings of previous determinations are also discussed. For both parameters, the coefficients of an interpolating equation are given, which are suitable for use in applications requiring high precision. The overall uncertainty in the specific heat ratio is estimated to be less than 320 ppm and the uncertainty in the speed of sound is similarly estimated to be less than 300 ppm.}",
