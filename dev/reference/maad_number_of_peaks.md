# Compute the number of peaks using scikit-maad

Count the number of frequency peaks on a mean spectrum. This function
was adapted from the function fpeaks of the R package Seewave (Sueur et
al. 2008) .

## Usage

``` r
maad_number_of_peaks(
  object,
  mode = "dB",
  min_peak_val = NULL,
  min_freq_dist = 200,
  slopes = c(1, 1),
  prominence = 0,
  maad = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A Wave object or a spectrogram_maad object generated by
  [`maad_spectrogram`](https://sonicscrewdriver.ebaker.me.uk/dev/reference/maad_spectrogram.md).
  If a Wave-like object is provided, the spectrogram will be calculated
  using the default parameters.

- mode:

  One of "dB", "linear".

- min_peak_val:

  Only peaks above this threshold will be considered.

- min_freq_dist:

  Frequency threshold parameter (in Hz). If the frequency difference of
  two successive peaks is less than this threshold, then the peak of
  highest amplitude will be kept only.

- slopes:

  Refers to the amplitude slopes of the peak. The first value is the
  left slope and the second value is the right slope. Only peaks with
  higher slopes than threshold values will be kept.

- prominence:

  The first element is the minimal prominence and the second element is
  the maximal prominence. If a single number is provided it is
  interpreted as the minimal value, and no maximal value will be used.

- maad:

  An optional maad object. If not provided, one will be created using
  [`getMaad()`](https://sonicscrewdriver.ebaker.me.uk/dev/reference/getMaad.md).

## Value

Numeric number of peaks
