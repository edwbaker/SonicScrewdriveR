# Compute the acoustic complexity index using scikit-maad

ACI depends on the duration of the spectrogram as the derivation of the
signal is normalized by the sum of the signal. Thus, if the background
noise is high due to high acoustic activity the normalization by the sum
of the signal reduced ACI. So ACI is low when there is no acoustic
activity or high acoustic activity with continuous background noise. ACI
is high only when acoustic activity is medium, with sounds well above
the background noise.

## Usage

``` r
maad_acoustic_complexity_index(object, maad = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A Wave object or a spectrogram_maad object generated by
  [`maad_spectrogram`](https://sonicscrewdriver.ebaker.me.uk/dev/reference/maad_spectrogram.md).
  If a Wave-like object is provided, the spectrogram will be calculated
  using the default parameters.

- maad:

  An optional maad object. If not provided, one will be created using
  [`getMaad()`](https://sonicscrewdriver.ebaker.me.uk/dev/reference/getMaad.md).

## Value

List comprising:

- ACI_xx:

  Acoustic Complexity Index.

- ACI_per_bin:

  Acoustic Complexity Index.

- ACI_sum:

  Sum of ACI value per frequency bin (Common definition)
