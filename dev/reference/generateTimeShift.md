# Generated time-shifted versions of a Wave-like object

Given a Wave-like object (or list of Wave-like objects), this function
generates time-shifted versions of the object. The time-shifted versions
are generated by adding a constant amount of time to the start or end of
the object. This is achieved by either inserting silence and truncating
the object to the original length, or by rotating the audio within the
object.

## Usage

``` r
generateTimeShift(
  wave,
  type = "silent",
  amount = c(1, 2),
  where = "start",
  output = "list"
)
```

## Arguments

- wave:

  A Wave-like object or list of Wave-like objects.

- type:

  The type of time-shift to apply. Either "silent" or "rotate".

- amount:

  Vector of amount of time to shift by (seconds).

- where:

  Where to insert silence if `type` is "silent".

- output:

  Return a list.

## Value

A Wave-like object or list of Wave-like objects.
