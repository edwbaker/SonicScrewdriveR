# Calculate the shimmer in a Wave object

Jitter is a measure of the variability of amplitudes within periods in
the waveform. Relative shimmer is scaled by the shimmer in the analysed
waveform.

## Usage

``` r
shimmer(wave)
```

## Arguments

- wave:

  A Wave object

## Value

A vector of zero crossing locations

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
shimmer(sheep)
} # }
```
